<b>Abstract:</b> In this modern era of technology almost everyone using smartphone and spent most of there time using it. As the technology advances we want to save our time as much as possible. So calling and texting beome essential for people, to do that we need to swipe and press but with our app within one press you can text anyone or call anyone. All you need to do is just give a voice command. So rather than wasting time on swiping you can save your time just one press and a voice command.

<b>Objectives:</b> We are going to create an virtual mobile assistant application called <b>Friday</b> which will take voice command from user and execute it. With this user need to press and give voice command like to call someone named Ria user need to say ‘Call Ria’ or to text user need to say “Text Ria that ‘your message’”. User can listen music with voice command ‘play music’. In the dark to turn the torch on user don’t need to scroll or swipe, with this app “flash on” voice command will turn on the flash immediately. So with these features people can save many minutes everyday to be more productive.
